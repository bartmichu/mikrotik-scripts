Various MikroTik / RouterOS scripts that I use.

## storage-monitor
This script will send you email notification if used space on your device is greater than selected threshold value.


## update-monitor
This script will send you email notification if it finds a newer version of RouterOS package on MikroTik servers or when it finds that a RouterBOOT loader update is awaiting installation on your device. However, it will not apply any updates for you.
